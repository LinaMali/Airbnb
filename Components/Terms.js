                Thank you for using Airbnb!<br/> <br/> <br/>        
                These Terms of Service for European Users (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement
                 between you and Airbnb that govern your right to use the websites, applications,
                  and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the “Airbnb Platform”). When used 
                  in these Terms,<b> “Airbnb,” “we,” “us,” or “our”</b> refers to the Airbnb entity set out
                   on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.  <br/><br/>            
                The Airbnb Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, 
                offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” 
                and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations
                 (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions and events (“Experiences”), and a variety
                  of travel and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host Service
                   offering, a “Listing”). You must register an account to access and use many
                    features of the Airbnb Platform, and must keep your account information accurate.
                     As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or
                      manage any Listings, Host Services, or tourism services. Airbnb is not a party
                       to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb 
                       a real estate broker, travel agency, insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel
                        packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any
                         capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service 
                         (“Payment Terms”). To learn more about Airbnb’s role see Section 16.    <br/><br/>           
                We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy,
                 which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which 
                 govern any payment services provided to Members by the Airbnb payment entities
                  (collectively "Airbnb Payments").          <br/><br/>
                If you Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, 
                rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services.</p>

            <h4>1. Our Mission.</h4>
            <p>Our mission is to create a world where you can belong anywhere. 
                From cabins to castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of Listings to 
                find the ones that fit the way you like to travel. Learn more about a Listing by reviewing the description 
                and photos, the Host profile, and past Guest reviews. If you have questions, just message the Host.</p>
            <h4>2. Searching and Booking on Airbnb.</h4>
            <p><b>2.1 Searching.</b> You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service,
                 travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search
                  results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance
                   considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history,
                    popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights),
                     and more. Learn more about search results in our Help Center.<br/><br/>
                <b>2.2 Booking. </b> you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your 
                booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee, offline fees,
                 taxes and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). 
                 When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (a "Reservation")
                  is formed directly between you and the Host. In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to, 
                  and responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation, including without limitation,
                   the cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements 
                   identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation.
                    It is your responsibility to read and understand these rules, standards, policies,
                     and requirements prior to booking a Listing. Be aware that some Hosts work with a
                      co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.    <br/><br/>          
              <b>  2.3 Accommodation Reservations.</b> An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, 
              occupy and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your
               stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host,
                and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right 
                to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable 
                overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.  <br/><br/>      
             <b>  2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services. </b>An Experience or other Host Service
              Reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service. You are responsible for
               confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements. 
               You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or 
               other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend or use the
                Host Service. Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to 
                join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.</p>
            <h4>3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.</h4>
            <p>Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds. In general, if you cancel a reservation, the amount
                 refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. 
                 But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you.
                  If something outside your control requires you to cancel a reservation, you may be entitled 
                  to a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Host cancels,
                   or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Rebooking and Refund Policy),
                    you may be entitled to rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under 
                    our Rebooking and Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories 
                    of Listings; for example, Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences
                     Guest Refund Policy, and Luxe Reservations are governed by the Luxe Rebooking and
                      Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term or Policy for details about what is 
                      covered, and what refund applies in each situation. You may appeal a decision by 
                      Airbnb by contacting our customer service.</p>
            <h4>4. Your Responsibilities.</h4>
            <p><b>You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions 
                of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation or Experience. For example,
                 this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) 
                 in the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all Damage Claim
                  amounts necessary to cover damage that you, your guest(s), or your pet(s) cause to an Accommodation,
                   and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect and comply with applicable 
                   laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring
                    a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor
                     and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.</b></p>
                     <h2>Host Terms</h2>
                     <h4>5. Hosting on Airbnb.</h4>
            <p>5. Hosting on Airbnb.Host. As a Host, Airbnb offers you the right to use the Airbnb Platform
                 to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests
                  - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create 
                a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.</p>
            <h4>Taxes</h4>
            <p>ax Information. In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we 
                collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both.
                 If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any
                  such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount 
                  as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided. You agree that Airbnb may issue 
                  on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or 
                other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by our Guests and their organizations.</p>
