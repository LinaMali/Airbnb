        <h1>Do I have to be a host or a guest to work at Airbnb?</h1>
        <p>No. But it helps! Passion and a deep understanding of our product are common themes among all of us who work at Airbnb. We recognize that not everyone has the opportunity to host or travel often, but we do encourage you to create a profile and spend some time getting to know the site and our story.</p>

        <h1>I just submitted my application, what can I expect?</h1>
        <p>We aim to respond to everyone within 3-4 weeks. At that time, we’ll let you know if we’d like to speak with you, need more information, or if your application isn’t a fit for what we’re looking for at the time.

        <h1>If I’m turned down, will you provide me with feedback so that I can improve?</h1>
        <p>We know that constructive criticism is really important for your career path, 
            but because of the sheer volume of applications,
             it’s likely that you won’t receive personalized feedback.</p>

    <div className="FAQ">
        <h1>I expected a more personalized experience — is there a human on the other side?</h1>
        <p>While our small team loves personal communication, we want to get you the most 
            pertinent information as swiftly as possible. 
            This doesn’t always allow for us to reply individually, but your experience is important to us.</p>

    <div className="FAQ">
        <h1>There are a lot of exciting jobs listed in other countries - can I apply even though I don’t live in that country?</h1>
        <p>For the most part we only consider applicants who are already legally able to work in the country that the job is based in. Visa sponsorship is very rare and is only for specialized positions.</p>

        <h1>What is the interview process like at Airbnb?</h1>
        <p>Just like working here, the interview process is both rigorous and fun! Depending on the position, 
            it may involve taking a test, making a video, or joining us for an event. Once the interview process has begun,
             we make it a priority for candidates to meet with multiple individuals on the current team. It’s important to
              us that you and the
             team have every opportunity to ask the questions needed to make sure the position is right for you.</p>

    <div className="FAQ">
        <h1>I have all of the qualifications listed, but I wasn’t offered an interview. Why?</h1>
        <p>We wish that we could speak with every candidate, but the number of highly qualified applicants for a role is often too high to allow for it.
             We personally review about 15,000 applications each month!</p>
